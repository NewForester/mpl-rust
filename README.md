<!-- mpl-rust by NewForester:  notes and examples of Rust -->

# MPL Rust

This repository contains:

  * notes made while studying Rust tutorial(s);
  * exercises and examples from the tutorial(s);
  * solutions to exercises on the [Exercism](http://exercism.io/languages/rust/about) and similar web sites;
  * any other Rust notes, exercises and examples of my own devising.

The study resulted from a desire to understand better some of the modern programming languages developed during the
early years of the 21st century and the advantages they have for software systems development.

The notes and exercises are not a management investigation into why an organisation should use Rust
but a technical investigation into what you would need to understand in order to begin programming in Rust.

While the material here is my own, it owes a great deal to the tutorial(s) and the Exercism project.

For more detailed and pragmatic notes on Rust, its installation and the facilities it offers,
see [md/Rust Refresher.md](md/ RefresherRust.md) (or [html/Rust Refresher.html](html/Rust Refresher.html)).
