<!-- mpl-rust by NewForester:  programming notes on and examples in Rust -->

<h1 id="rust-refresher-notes">Rust Refresher Notes</h1>
<p>Anyone can remember things they use everyday but it is not everyday one reinstalls a programming language. No matter how well one knows a programming language, some details fade if one spends any length of time using another.</p>
<p>Below is not a Rust tutorial but quick refresher notes. Hopefully just enough to bring back all you do know that has slipped just beyond the instant recall threshold.</p>
<p>Do not forget to update these notes with what you have learnt since they were written.</p>
<h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rust_(programming_language)">Rust</a> is modern systems programming language sponsored by Mozilla Research that first appeared in 2010.</p>
<p>Rust is a compiled language that follows the structured / imperative paradigm but also supports generic and functional programming. The language is strongly and statically typed but features type inference and structural typing. Memory management does not include garbage collection.</p>
<p>Rust features concurrency but memory safety without a performance penalty is its defining characteristic.</p>
<p>The current stable release is 1.25.0 (released March 29 2018).</p>
<p>Rust, its compiler and tools are free and open source and available under either Apache or MIT licences.</p>
<p>Rust seeks to improve on C++ with a feature set that emphasises safety, control of memory layout and concurrency. Together with features to support the creation and maintenance of 'boundaries' these support &quot;programming in the large&quot;.</p>
<p>Rust is not a class-based object oriented language but provides 'implementations', without inheritance, and 'traits' (along the lines of Haskell) that provide inheritance and polymorphism.</p>
<p>The use of 'traits' to implement polymorphism allows structural type checking at compile time but still involves separate, optimised, code for each instantiation.</p>
<p>Rust has a package and build automation system named Cargo.</p>
