<!-- mpl-rust by NewForester:  programming notes on and examples in Rust -->

<h1 id="rust-refresher-notes">Rust Refresher Notes</h1>
<p>Anyone can remember things they use everyday but it is not everyday one reinstalls a programming language. No matter how well one knows a programming language, some details fade if one spends any length of time using another.</p>
<p>Below is not a Rust tutorial but quick refresher notes. Hopefully just enough to bring back all you do know that has slipped just beyond the instant recall threshold.</p>
<p>Do not forget to update these notes with what you have learnt since they were written.</p>
<h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rust_(programming_language)">Rust</a> is modern systems programming language sponsored by Mozilla Research that first appeared in 2010.</p>
<p>Rust is a compiled language that follows the structured / imperative paradigm but also supports generic and functional programming. The language is strongly and statically typed but features type inference and structural typing. Memory management does not include garbage collection.</p>
<p>Rust features concurrency but memory safety without a performance penalty is its defining characteristic.</p>
<p>The current stable release is 1.25.0 (released March 29 2018).</p>
<p>Rust, its compiler and tools are free and open source and available under either Apache or MIT licences.</p>
<p>Rust seeks to improve on C++ with a feature set that emphasises safety, control of memory layout and concurrency. Together with features to support the creation and maintenance of 'boundaries' these support &quot;programming in the large&quot;.</p>
<p>Rust is not a class-based object oriented language but provides 'implementations', without inheritance, and 'traits' (along the lines of Haskell) that provide inheritance and polymorphism.</p>
<p>The use of 'traits' to implement polymorphism allows structural type checking at compile time but still involves separate, optimised, code for each instantiation.</p>
<p>Rust has a package and build automation system named Cargo.</p>
<p>The official web-site is <a href="www.rust-lang.org">https://www.rust-lang.org/</a>.</p>
<h2 id="installation-upgrade-removal">Installation, Upgrade, Removal</h2>
<h3 id="installation">Installation</h3>
<p>Rust is available from Debian repositories from 'stretch' onwards but Cargo is only available from 'buster' onwards. As always with such things, the repositories do not have the current versions. Best to install the latest stable version from the Rust project.</p>
<h4 id="officially">Officially</h4>
<p>For *nix systems:</p>
<pre class="sourceCode bash"><code class="sourceCode bash">    $ curl https://sh.rustup.rs -sSf <span class="kw">|</span> <span class="kw">sh</span></code></pre>
<p>after first installing <code>curl</code>. Installation is to ~/.cargo/bin and it alters your profile.</p>
<p>The command executes a small shell script that downloads the <code>rust</code> installer. It will issue a single confirmation prompt. Press enter.</p>
<p>After confirmation, the install appears to download and install components. The four downloads are the order of 110 Mb in total and the final install 560 Mb but the installation requires more than this.</p>
<p>Under the <em>.cargo</em> directory are installed 9 binaries but this is all. The bulk of the installation (including the tool chain) is under <em>.rustup</em>.</p>
<h4 id="alternatively">Alternatively</h4>
<p>If you are installing language tools on another volume:</p>
<pre class="sourceCode bash"><code class="sourceCode bash">    $ <span class="kw">mkdir</span> /media/work/lang/rust;
    $ <span class="kw">sudo</span> <span class="kw">ln</span> -s /media/work/lang/rust/ /usr/local;
    $ <span class="kw">ln</span> -s /usr/local/rust .cargo;

    $ <span class="kw">mkdir</span> /media/work/lang/rustup;
    $ <span class="kw">ln</span> -s /media/work/lang/rustup/ .rustup;

    $ curl https://sh.rustup.rs -sSf <span class="kw">|</span> <span class="kw">sh</span>;</code></pre>
<h4 id="binaries">Binaries</h4>
<p>You do not need to alter your PATH if <em>/usr/local/bin</em> is already on it:</p>
<pre class="sourceCode bash"><code class="sourceCode bash">    $ <span class="kw">sudo</span> <span class="kw">ln</span> -s /usr/local/rust/bin/* /usr/local/bin;</code></pre>
<p>There are nine binaries.</p>
<h3 id="upgrade">Upgrade</h3>
<p><!-- More detail from practical experience --> Use <code>rustup</code>.</p>
<h3 id="removal">Removal</h3>
<p>This installation claims:</p>
<pre><code>    $ rustup self uninstall;</code></pre>
<p>is all that is needed.</p>
<p>Do not forget to tidy your PATH.</p>
